## The End Goal
**The End Goal**
We are/were trying to reach the goal of being able to fly the drone remotely via Visual Studio Code.
We want to be able to have buffers that automatically send once available, then onto the next line.

## The Issue
**Issue**
Our main issue is time and lack of knowledge on how to be able to run certain letters that mean who lines of code (in this type of code)
We also ran into the issue of the drone not giving feedback, and sometimes not connecting at all.


## The Steps Taken/Process
**What was done**
Ashton was able to code a 'battery?' loop to get feedback on the battery.
```
const dgram = require("dgram");
const server = dgram.createSocket("udp4");


server.send(Buffer.from("command"), 8889, "192.168.10.1"); 

setInterval(
  () => server.send(Buffer.from("battery?"), 8889, "192.168.10.1"),
  100
  ); 
  
  server.on("message", (msg, rinfo) =>
    console.log(`server got: ${msg} from ${rinfo.address}:${rinfo.port}`)
  );
  
  server.on("listening", () => {
   console.log("Listening")
  });
```
I was able to mess around with the commands and figured out how far/fast/long each on was via trial and error

## The Mental Stress
**Stress**
The most stressful part of it all was the connection issue, of which is still being worked on. 
That is our main goal for next section...
